            Home to 54 countries, Africa has something for everyone. From
            Algeria's bone-dry Sahara desert to South Africa's iconic urban
            skylines, the second-largest continent in the world, too, has
            landscapes as diverse as its animal kingdoms. After all, it has the
            densest wildlife population of all places on earth, the lushest
            flora, spectacular landscapes unalatered by time, and a cultural
            diversity unrivaled anywhere.

            African savanna tours are one of the worldâ€™s most memorable wildlife
            experiences. To see lions laying in the shade or hunting prey,
            elephants foraging for food, or giraffes blocking your jeep for a
            photo or two offers not just a vacation, but a lifetime of memories.
